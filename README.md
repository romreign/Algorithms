# Algorithms
Hello everyone! This is my take on the STL standard library, which is planned to be expanded in the future.

## Library Contents
Each container is implemented as a template class using an allocator
At the moment the library contains the following containers, namely:
- binary tree
- doubly linked list
- vector

## Cloning a repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prnDmn1/Algorithms.git
